## Design philosphy
This keyboard was designed with FDM printing in mind, the goal was to create a perfect curved case that can be easily printed and looks aesthetically pleasing with minimal amount of so called "steps" that plague similar 3D keyboards like Dactyl Manuform, it's design is similar to the [Velvet v3](https://github.com/ergohaven/velvet) keyboard but with 60% layout and addition of various interchangeable modules
